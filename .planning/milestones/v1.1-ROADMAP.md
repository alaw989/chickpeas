## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| @vueuse/motion over GSAP | Lighter weight, native Nuxt integration, sufficient for subtle animations |
| CSS scroll-driven for parallax | Zero JS overhead, good browser support |
| 1024px parallax breakpoint | Disables on mobile/touch for performance and UX |
| 50ms stagger interval | Keeps total animation time reasonable with many menu items |
| visible-once over visible | Prevents replay on scroll out/in for cleaner UX |
| SVG clipPath for map pin | Clean circular masking for brand logo |

## Files Modified

- `package.json` - Added @vueuse/motion dependency
- `nuxt.config.ts` - Added @vueuse/motion/nuxt module
- `assets/css/main.css` - prefers-reduced-motion CSS
