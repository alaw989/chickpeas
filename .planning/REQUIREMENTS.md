# Requirements: Chickpeas v1.2 - Specials & QR Menu

**Defined:** 2026-02-11
**Core Value:** Visitors can quickly find the menu, hours, location, and contact the restaurant

## v1.2 Requirements

### Specials

- [ ] **SPEC-01**: Specials section displays below hero on homepage
- [ ] **SPEC-02**: Each special shows photo, name, price, description
- [ ] **SPEC-03**: Section supports multiple specials at once
- [ ] **SPEC-04**: Section hidden when no active specials exist
- [ ] **SPEC-05**: Specials manageable from WordPress admin (custom post type or ACF)

### QR Menu

- [ ] **QR-01**: QR code image links to menu page URL
- [ ] **QR-02**: QR code provided as printable file (PNG/SVG)

## Out of Scope

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Scheduled specials (start/end dates) | Keep it simple — manual publish/unpublish |
| Special categories | Not needed for small number of specials |
| Dynamic QR code generation | Static image sufficient, URL won't change |
| QR code in WordPress admin | One-time generation is enough |

## Traceability

| Requirement | Phase | Status |
