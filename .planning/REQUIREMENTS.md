## Out of Scope

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Scheduled specials (start/end dates) | Keep it simple — manual publish/unpublish |
| Special categories | Not needed for small number of specials |
| Dynamic QR code generation | Static image sufficient, URL won't change |
| QR code in WordPress admin | One-time generation is enough |
