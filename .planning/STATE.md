## Key Decisions

| Decision | Date | Context |
|----------|------|---------|
| Use @vueuse/motion | 2026-02-10 | Lightweight, Nuxt-native, sufficient for subtle animations |
| CSS scroll-driven for parallax | 2026-02-10 | Zero JS overhead, good browser support |
| Quick depth | 2026-02-10 | Focused scope, 3 phases |
| Nuxt module auto-imports | 2026-02-10 | Using @vueuse/motion/nuxt for auto-imported v-motion directive |
| 50ms stagger interval | 2026-02-10 | Keeps total animation time reasonable with many menu items |
| 1024px parallax breakpoint | 2026-02-10 | Disables parallax on mobile/touch for performance and UX |
| Staggered delays 0/100/200ms | 2026-02-10 | Cascade timing for section scroll animations |
| visible-once over visible | 2026-02-10 | Prevents replay on scroll out/in for cleaner UX |
